# Update subscription

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Renew a subscription by extending its expiry time.

Subscriptions expire after a length of time that varies by resource type. In order to avoid missing notifications, an app should renew its subscriptions well in advance of their expiry date. See [subscription](../resources/subscription.md) for maximum length of a subscription for each resource type.

## Permissions

The following table lists the suggested permission needed for each resource. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Resource type / Item        | Permission          |
|-----------------------------|---------------------|
| Contacts                    | Contacts.Read       |
| Conversations               | Group.Read.All      |
| Events                      | Calendars.Read      |
| Messages                    | Mail.Read           |
| Groups                      | Group.Read.All      |
| Users                       | User.Read.All       |
| Drive  (User's OneDrive)    | Files.ReadWrite     |
| Drives (SharePoint shared content and drives) | Files.ReadWrite.All |
|Security alert               | SecurityEvents.ReadWrite.All |

***Note:*** The /beta endpoint allows application permissions for most resources. Conversations in a Group and OneDrive drive root items are not supported with application permissions.
